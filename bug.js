This error occurs when you try to access a property of a component's state or props before the component has mounted.  In React Native, this often happens when you use asynchronous operations or when you're trying to access data within a function that's called before the component is fully rendered.

```javascript
// Buggy component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> 
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
